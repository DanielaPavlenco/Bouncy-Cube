`BouncyCubeActivity.java`: The main activity of the app that sets up the GLSurfaceView and the CubeRenderer.
`CubeRenderer.java`: The renderer for the cube that handles drawing the cube on the screen.
`Cube.java`: The model for the cube that defines its vertices, colors, and faces.

### Acknowledgments
